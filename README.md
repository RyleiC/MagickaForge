Magicka Forge is a tool for creating modded XNB files for the 2011 game Magicka by Arrowhead.
The tool uses JSON files as an aim to make modding more accessible and quicker than if the files were manually edited using hexidecimal editors.

XNBs generated by Magicka Forge should be placed inside Magicka/Content/Data/items/Items_NPC or Magicka/Content/Data/items/Items_Wizard, after which this allows them to be be loaded into the vanilla game just like any other item.
Two example items are provided inside of the Example folders, these can be tinkered as need be.

A guide is in the works to add for more accessibility.
