Magicka Forge is a tool written in C# for creating modded XNB files for the 2011 game Magicka by Arrowhead. (Requires the .NET 8.0 Framework)
The tool uses JSON files as an aim to make modding more accessible and quicker than if the files were manually edited using hexidecimal editors with decompressed XNB files.

XNBs generated by Magicka Forge should be placed inside Magicka/Content/Data/items/Items_Wizard for items or Magicka/Content/Data/characters after which will allow them to be be loaded into the vanilla game just like any other item.
Two example items are provided inside of the Example folders as well as an example character.
2 text files containing both an explanation for Item variables and options are present and a character guide is on the works.
